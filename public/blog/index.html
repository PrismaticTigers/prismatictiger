                So I've been sick for the past several days, had to have time
                off from work to recover, but I'm getting there... in other
                news, I've been playing new club penguin lately! It's been
                really nostalgic to play, and I've been grinding for coins as
                usual.
              </p>
              <p>
                I haven't been drawing as much, but I have been doing 3d art, so
                at least there's that. I've been really bored lately which is
                funny because you'd think I'd be utilizing all of my time since
                I've had time off from work, but for the most part I think it's
                just me kind of adjusting to the new month if anything.

                I hate calling people "ex", and it's still fresh... so I'll just
                say "my close friend" for now... me and my close friend have
                luckily been coping together lately, and decided to try and
                hangout as usual and not wait too long on it or else things will
                start to get more and more scary to reapproach. I'm happy about
                this, but it sure is going to hurt at first, like dipping my
                toes into water that's too hot or cold.

                It should be ok though for the most part, and I'm glad he's in
                the process of improving himself I guess? Regarding the reason
                why we aren't really a thing anymore. I like to say "for now"
                just because thankfully it wasn't a result from us fighting all
                the time, falling out of love, or anything like that.

                So around September of this year, I had broken up with my
                previous boyfriend of 4 years. At around the same time I started
                talking to someone who matched my energy entirely, and is the
                brother of a long-term friend of mine as well. After a month
                however, just last night I was broken up with not from him
                falling out of love, or anything on my end. It was the decision
                as a result from other personal things, and it hurts like all
                hell but I'm glad we're still close friends. I'd be lying if I
                said there wasn't the constant thought of wanting to get back
                together in the future, but I'm coping in what ways I know how.

                I don't really have a whole network/group of friends
                unfortunately, so I usually just confide in my mom and sister.
