        <h1>Unfamiliar Identity</h1>
        <time datetime="2021-05-30">30 May, 2021</time>
        <p>It was a warm, cozy room with a bed and cushions scattered across the floor. I was not who I remember always
          being; I was in a different body, and my thoughts were different. This girl, around the age of 22â€“24, was
          hugging me and being very affectionate towards me. I felt a vague familiarity, yet I also felt as if I was
          faking being someone else, almost as if I were a clone and she was oblivious to it. I decided to put on a mask
          and go along with it, and she seemed happy as a result.</p>
        <p>After quite some time and many outings that seemed very much like dates together, we returned to the
          oh-so-comfortable bedroom. I decided it didn't feel right to continue this lie, so I told her the truth. "I'm
          not unintelligible..."</p>
        <p>Her face shifted, thinking I had just said some sort of sick joke. "That's not right; you're lying," is what
          I'm sure she said to me.</p>
        <p>"I'm not unintelligible. I'm not lying; I've been trying to act like her this entire time to not upset you.
          I'm sorry." is what I managed to reply with. (She did not take this well.) She began to cry, thrash her arms
          about, scream, and yell at me as if I had murdered her significant other and she had just walked in on the
          scene. "I'm sorry, I was scared to not act like her; I was scared to show myself." I furthered my explanation,
          but it had no effect on her current state.</p>
        <p>"Get out!" is what she shouted over her tears. "Leave, now!" she shouted at me yet again. Telling the truth
          had a consequence, but it was the right thing to do. I was not unintelligible. I was me.</p>
