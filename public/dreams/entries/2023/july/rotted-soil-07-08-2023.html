        <p>
          I was standing, emotionless at the center of the main room. The
          rhythm of my heart was unsteady as I crept over to one of the
          guestrooms. Opening the door, I was greeted by an older man,
          possibly in his late 60's. I blinked, rubbing at my eyes as
          everything slowly begun to distort. Explicit images of women's bare
          bottoms and odd depictions of feces scrolled along the walls similar
          to a slideshow. The man now looked a bit off; diseased, or a
          nonhuman being.
        </p>

        <p>
          Disgusted, I couldn't help but block the sight of it with my hand,
          and attempted to run away through squinted eyes. The house brittle,
          yet solid. Where was I? I followed the main room's walls until I
          happened upon the basement door. Cotton in my ears, I used the
          stairs down further, darker, dimly lit until I reached the bottom.
          The floor was muddied with dirt, filth, and reeked of body odor. I
          hesitantly groped at my surroundings, my vision suddenly clearer. I
          scratched at my body, the feeling of bugs over my skin. I felt as if
          my heart was in my throat, it was the man again. How can I save him?
          Is he like this forever? He looked simultaneously pleased with
          himself yet extremely embarrassed over his interests. The smell of
          rottenness and grime forcefully filled my nose. I retched, unable to
          use my hands against my face as a result from the fear of disease
          contaminating my mouth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Backing away, I backtracked upstairs, only to trip on one of the
          steps. The sound of an unidentifiable thing speaking to me in a
          raspy voice, threatening me with some kind of sick joke. Shit. My
          limbs feel weak, it's hard to use them. I'm so fucking scared. As I
          finally reached the top of the stairs, I could see a woman now in
          the scarce light, the guestroom has begun to leak into the main room
          now, nothing but those images were circling around, the woman was
          also nearly the same age as the man, only she looked very lifeless,
          her movements were uncanny. Where the fuck am I? Can I escape? I ran
          to what I believed was the front door, only to enter a dark room
          with the sound of cicadas and crickets. I can't see a fucking thing.
          Am I outside? I smelled death. Nothing but rotted soil and stagnant
          air.
        <p>I wake up. The man and woman in front of me, only they look
          happier. Fuck, I'm finally out of there. I walked to the guestroom.
          The same thing. The same fucking thing. The woman behind me, her
          eyes missing this time. I shoved her aside, nothing but rooms and
          rooms. I was lost. The kitchen? Not anymore. Children? Fucking
          children? Please God no. Help me fucking god, get me out of here.
          The children were laughing and playing, but I couldn't make out
          their faces, it was too dark. They didn't look phased in the
          slightest. Not scared, not crying for help. I couldn't help but feel
          responsible for them. "Do you two need help?" I was choking on my
          fucking words. I felt lightheaded, for a split second I almost
          forgot everything.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          What do you want from me? I just want this to end, I want it to all
          stop...
