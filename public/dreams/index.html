        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my dream journal! This is very messy atm, but I plan on making this look a LOT better and sorting
          things by "dreams" and "nightmares"...</p>
        <p>Not 100% sure how to theme this page, but I think I might lean a bit more into a liminal vibe, especially
          since in a way, this is a coping mechanism I'm making as a result from my tendency to have long, vivid and
          most of the time distressing dreams.</p>
        <p>Please navigate with the links located to the left!</p>
        <p>Feel free to listen to some ambient breakcore-ish music for background as well...</p>
