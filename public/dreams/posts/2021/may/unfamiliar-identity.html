        <h1>Unfamiliar Identity</h1>
        <time class="postdate" datetime="2021-05-30">30 May, 2021</time>
        
    <p>It was a warm, cozy room with a bed and cushions scattered across the floor. I was not who I remember always
being; I was in a different body, and my thoughts were different. This girl, around the age of 22–24, was
hugging me and being very affectionate towards me. I felt a vague familiarity, yet I also felt as if I was
faking being someone else, almost as if I were a clone and she was oblivious to it. I decided to put on a mask
and go along with it, and she seemed happy as a result.</p>
<p>After quite some time and many outings that seemed very much like dates together, we returned to the
oh-so-comfortable bedroom. I decided it didn't feel right to continue this lie, so I told her the truth. &quot;I'm
not unintelligible...&quot;</p>
<p>Her face shifted, thinking I had just said some sort of sick joke. &quot;That's not right; you're lying,&quot; is what
I'm sure she said to me.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not unintelligible. I'm not lying; I've been trying to act like her this entire time to not upset you.
I'm sorry.&quot; is what I managed to reply with. (She did not take this well.) She began to cry, thrash her arms
about, scream, and yell at me as if I had murdered her significant other and she had just walked in on the
scene. &quot;I'm sorry, I was scared to not act like her; I was scared to show myself.&quot; I furthered my explanation,
but it had no effect on her current state.</p>
<p>&quot;Get out!&quot; is what she shouted over her tears. &quot;Leave, now!&quot; she shouted at me yet again. Telling the truth
had a consequence, but it was the right thing to do. I was not unintelligible. I was me.</p>
