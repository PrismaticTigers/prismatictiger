    <p>We were in a parking lot. It was a challenge to see who had the best
prank. <span class="redacted">xxxx</span> decided it would be funny
to use an unidentifiable cleaning product on his face and act like
he was in danger. Just as the prank was playing out, panic set in. I
was suddenly placed in the point of view of
<span class="redacted">xxxx</span> . I could feel an intense burning
sensation around my eyes and in my throat. It was unbearable; it
progressively worsened even after an attempt to rinse it off with
water.</p>
<p>I blinked, and I was back in my own body. The paramedics rushed
<span class="redacted">xxxx</span> to the hospital. I could see his
vitals, which were rapidly dropping. My heart was pounding, and I
was escorted out by some nurses, as they were going to do everything
they could to get him into a stable state.</p>
<p>I was wandering around the city, anxiously thinking about what the
outcome would be. Should I be positive and hope for the best, or
prepare myself for the worst? I wasn't ready to make a decision, and
I don't know why this had to be happening. A lot of things happen
when I least expect them, but why does it have to be horrible things
with dire consequences? At the corner of my eye, I could see my
mother in a future-esque car with armor on it, but the armor was
lowered, similar to a convertible.</p>
<p>Others were in the car as well; it could seat more than eight
people. I buckled my seatbelt and looked behind me. the worry for
<span class="redacted">xxxx</span> off of my mind for a moment.
&quot;What's happening?&quot; Is the only thing I could manage to ask, but I
couldn't make out what the answer to it was.</p>
<p>Some time had gone by. After exiting the car, I was approached by
one of the passengers, who was a friend of
<span class="redacted">xxxx</span> . &quot;We got the results back.&quot; I
couldn't believe it. I held my breath, I prepared for the worst.
&quot;Things weren't looking too good for him.&quot; I was fighting back
tears. I couldn't stand the suspense. Fucking say it already. Tell
me he's dead. Suddenly, the friend's lips curled. into a smile.
&quot;He's stable, and he's okay.&quot; He's going to make it!&quot; I was already
fighting my tears, but I couldn't hold them back any longer. Both me
and him started letting our tears of relief fall as we both
embraced. It was truly a time for celebration, and I knew that the
next opportunity I had to speak with
<span class="redacted">xxxx</span> I would be sure to smack the back
of his head and tell him to never do anything like that again.</p>
