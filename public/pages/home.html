        <h2>What kind of layouts do you offer?</h2>
        <p>My layouts mostly take inspiration from old Xanga pages for others to freely use so they're able to either re-experience, or newly experience having a nice, simple page of their own with an easy navigation system!</p>
        <h2>What do you hope to achieve with your site?</h2>
        <p>I hope to eventually have all of the resources/codes/layouts provided by me available to others so my website can potentially become a resource hub that others find useful; whether it be with my layouts, graphics, or tutorials!</p>
        <h2>Any plans for future content?</h2>
        <p>Things I definitely want to add are original page pixel/graphic adoptables, dividers, favicons, etc. I have a lot in store that I hope to eventually hope to incorporate, as well as any suggestions others may be looking for!</p>
