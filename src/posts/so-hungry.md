## Life is Great

PRETTY BAD TIME TO TYPE UP AN ENTRY... with it being idk... 1:46am and all... anyways, I've recently been trying to be active on Neocities again! :D I have a lot of plans, especially since I've been spending these last couple months dedicated to learning everything webdev and design and everything is just FULL of creative ideas honestly. I think the one thing though that I wish I was better at is just randomly striking up conversations with others who enjoy doing similar activities (coding and drawing and stuff T_T) Why is it that I almost feel like I was better at making friends when I was younger compared to now?

## Old Habits Die Hard

JLFDJDFJFDBJFD... I'm glad I've overcome most of my social anxiety though, it's just mostly my ability to randomly reach out to people and talk among a group of others.. IT'S LIKE?? WHAT... Honestly, if I'm being extremely honest, it might even be my persistent fear of accidentally talking over people, or not being a part of an active conversation etc. as a result from growing up in a big family full of people with ADHD (including myself, hi) but being the youngest, I still often find it difficult talking to family members when it's more than just me and one other person unfortunately... :D And it's just me, my mom, and oldest sister in the house atm since everyone else has already moved out at this point. IT'S OK, THOUGH. I still get along with them, and I have my omega gay boyfriend to gush about things to!! T\_\_\_T

### Adhd is Hell

I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT... not much else to say though really, I'm just really happy people exist online for the most part. There are so many people I have yet to meet, and I think a new goal of mine will be to at least TRY to like, make a bit of an effort to make conversation with people my age that I can heavily relate to OTL
